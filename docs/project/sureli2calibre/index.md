# Sureli2Calibre

This is an automation script written in Python 2 to add periodicals to an Calibre library. As an electronics engineer, I am trying to follow and read some electronics related e-magazines. I am using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to store and categorize them. If you haven’t heard of Calibre, you should check out it. I wrote this script to add issues of magazines to my Calibre library according to their file names automatically.

Files are published on GitHub and the link is just given below. You may download from that page.
